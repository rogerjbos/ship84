Ship 84 has three vessels.  Our flagship is a 40-foot sailboat called The Resolution.  We also have a 3o-foot called The Kolga.  Finally, we have a small fishing boat called The Mako.

The Resolution is a Hinckley Bermuda 40 yawl sailboat.  The Resolution will not be in the water for the 2020 season while we perform restoration work such as sealing the teak wood, painting the deck, and replacing the head.  She will return to service in 2021.

The Kolga is our newest boat, which was donated to us in 2019.  This will be our primary sailboat for the 2020 season.
