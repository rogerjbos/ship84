      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&#39;s Markdown and Pandoc&#39;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>Ship 84 is a co-ed, Sea Scouts BSA ship located in Southport CT. We have been in operation since 1932. Our mission is to create youth leadership and personal development opportunities for 14 to 21 year-olds while teaching seamanship and safe boating skills through challenging and fun-filled programs at sea.
We meet with our youth members weekly 12 months of the year. In the fall and winter months we focus on studying and learning new skills, in the spring we do hands on boat maintenance and prepare for the boating season and during the summer we put it all together and sail aboard our 40-foot sailboat The Resolution or our 30-foot sailboat Kolga to various ports of call in Long Island Sound all the way to Block Island and Marthaâ€™s Vineyard.</description>

      <description>Ship 84 has three vessels. Our flagship is a 40-foot sailboat called The Resolution. We also have a 3o-foot called The Kolga. Finally, we have a small fishing boat called The Mako.
The Resolution is a Hinckley Bermuda 40 yawl sailboat. The Resolution will not be in the water for the 2020 season while we perform restoration work such as sealing the teak wood, painting the deck, and replacing the head.</description>
